# Model for genomic DNA data

See [the tutorial](https://github.com/daskelly/ase/blob/master/tutorial.pdf) 
for instructions on how to use the code in `orig` to run this model.

I am working on a re-implementation of this model using the Bayesian
modeling language [stan](mc-stan.org) but am still working out 
the details.
